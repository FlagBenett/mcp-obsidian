## Components

### Tools

The server implements multiple tools to interact with Obsidian:

- list_files_in_vault: Lists all files and directories in the root directory of your Obsidian vault
- list_files_in_dir: Lists all files and directories in a specific Obsidian directory
- get_file_contents: Return the content of a single file in your vault.
- search: Search for documents matching a specified text query across all files in the vault
- patch_content: Insert content into an existing note relative to a heading, block reference, or frontmatter field.
- append_content: Append content to a new or existing file in the vault.
- delete_file: Delete a file or directory from your vault.

### Example prompts

Its good to first instruct Claude to use Obsidian. Then it will always call the tool.

The use prompts like this:
- Get the contents of the last architecture call note and summarize them
- Search for all files where Azure CosmosDb is mentioned and quickly explain to me the context in which it is mentioned
- Summarize the last meeting notes and put them into a new note 'summary meeting.md'. Add an introduction so that I can send it via email.

## Configuration

### Obsidian REST API Key

There are two ways to configure the environment with the Obsidian REST API Key. 

1. Add to server config (preferred)

```json
{
  "mcp-obsidian": {
    "command": "uvx",
    "args": [
      "mcp-obsidian"
    ],
    "env": {
      "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY": "<your_api_key_here>",
      "OBSIDIAN_HOST": "<your_obsidian_host>",
      "OBSIDIAN_PORT": "<your_obsidian_port>"
    }
  }
}
```
Sometimes Claude has issues detecting the location of uv / uvx. You can use `which uvx` to find and paste the full path in above config in such cases.

2. Create a `.env` file in the working directory with the following required variables:

```
OBSIDIAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OBSIDIAN_HOST=your_obsidian_host
OBSIDIAN_PORT=your_obsidian_port
```

Note:
- You can find the API key in the Obsidian plugin config
- Default port is 27124 if not specified
- Default host is 127.0.0.1 if not specified

## Transport Modes

The MCP server supports two transport modes:

1. **HTTP Mode (Default)**: Runs on port 9091 with streamable HTTP transport
   - Compatible with MCP Inspector for debugging
   - Use: `uv run mcp-obsidian`

2. **Stdio Mode**: Runs with stdio transport for traditional MCP clients
   - Compatible with Claude Desktop and other stdio-based MCP clients
   - Use: `uv run mcp-obsidian --stdio`

## Quickstart

### Install

#### Obsidian REST API

You need the Obsidian REST API community plugin running: https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api

Install and enable it in the settings and copy the api key.

#### Claude Desktop

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

## Development

### Building

To prepare the package for distribution:

1. Sync dependencies and update lockfile:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Debugging

The server supports multiple debugging approaches:

#### MCP Inspector (HTTP Mode)

For the best debugging experience, use the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) with HTTP mode:

1. Start the server in HTTP mode:
```bash
uv run mcp-obsidian
```

2. Open the MCP Inspector in your browser and connect to:
   - **Transport type**: streamable-http
   - **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:9091/mcp`

#### Traditional Debugging (Stdio Mode)

You can also use the traditional stdio-based debugging:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/mcp-obsidian run mcp-obsidian --stdio
```

You can also watch the server logs with this command:

```bash
tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-mcp-obsidian.log
```
